# Presentation

This project provides an on-the-fly point of sale that can be deployed anywhere
where a power plug is available. It targets small events such as village fairs
that happen to run once a year. The initial focus is to sell food and drinks
through tickets that will then be exchanged at the different desks.

The project is build on top of the _Raspberry Pi 3_ and support all printers
that are supported by the [`python-escpos`][python-escpos] library.

# Installation

First you can go through the list of requirements to be sure that you have
everything. Then you can follow the section explaining how to prepare your
Raspberry Pi, and finally follow the section about deploying the project on the
device.

## Requirements

These are the minimum requirements to run _raposfly_: 

- Raspberry Pi 3
  - Power plug
  - Ethernet cable
- MicroSD card `>= 8G`
  - MicroSD to SD apdapter
  - SD card reader
- Thermal printer supported by the [`python-escpos`][python-escpos] library.

## Preparation of the Raspberry Pi

In order to run _raposfly_, the Raspberry Pi should be prepared for serving as a
WIFI access point, with a DHCP server, a DNS server, a firewall, a docker engine
and an USB setup to access the printer. It is quite a lot, but these steps only
have to be done once.

This procedure has been tested on the version:

![September 2016](https://img.shields.io/badge/raspbian--lite-September%202016-brightgreen.svg)


### Install and configure the rasbian-lite distribution

Get [`raspbian-lite`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/):

- [Direct download](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest)
- [Torrent](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest.torrent)

Usually downloading by torrent is faster than direct download.

[Write the `.img`][write-img] to the microSD card by using the microSD to SD
adapter and the SD card reader.

Once this has been done, you can put the SD card in the Rasberry Pi, plug the
ethernet cable and power it up. The rest of the procedure is meant to be run on
the Rasberry Pi directly. For this you will need
to [find the IP address][ip-address] of the Rasberry on the network,
and [ssh into it][ssh] (default password for the `pi` account is `raspberry`):

    ssh pi@192.168.1.100
    
First the distribution can be updated with:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    
You may want to install `vim` if you prefer this over `nano`:

    sudo apt install -y vim
    
Whenever you need to edit or create a file, depending on your preferences you
will need to either use:

    sudo nano /path/to/filename

or
    
    sudo vim /path/to/filename

Before going further, be sure to restart your Raspberry Pi in order to reload
the kernel as it has probably be updated:

    sudo reboot
    
Wait one minute then reconnect to your Rasberry Pi with SSH after for continuing
the installation procedure.

### Install and configure the WIFI access-point

In order to use the Raspberry Pi as an access point, `hostapd` need to be
installed, as well as `iptables-persistent` that is needed to restore the
defined routes at each boot:

    sudo apt install -y hostapd iptables-persistent
    
Answer `No` to the 2 questions that are asked about `iptables-persistent`.
    
Create the file `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf` and add the following content:

    interface=wlan0
    ssid=Pi_AP
    country_code=US
    hw_mode=g
    channel=6
    macaddr_acl=0
    auth_algs=1
    ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
    wpa=2
    wpa_passphrase=Raspberry
    wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    wpa_pairwise=CCMP
    wpa_group_rekey=86400
    ieee80211n=1
    wme_enabled=1
  
Be sure to personalize this to set a custom `ssid` and a custom
`wpa_passphrase`. This will allow you to identify more easily your Raspberry Pi
network, and prevent other people to connect to your network with the default
credential.

Then you need to edit the file `/etc/default/hostapd` to indicate where to find
the configuration file we just created:

    DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"

*Note:* Be sure to remove the `#` in front of the line

Edit the file `/etc/init.d/hostapd` in the same vein to indicate which
configuration file to use:

    DAEMON_CONF=/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

Edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and uncomment the line to enable ip forwarding:

    net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Run this command to activate it for the current session without rebooting:

    sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"

Create the NAT rules to redirect `wlan0` trafic to `eth0`:

    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
    
And save them to be restored at boot time by `iptables-persistent`:

    sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4"

Remove the WPA supplicant service as it's not needed anymore:

    sudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/fi.epitest.hostap.WPASupplicant.service /root/

And finally make `hostapd` to start at boot:

    sudo systemctl enable hostapd
    
### Install and configure the DHCP server

In order to get an IP address when connecting to the Wifi, a DHCP server is
needed. The `isc-dhcp-server` package should be installed for this:

    sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server
    
Then edit `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` to comment out the following lines:

    # option definitions common to all supported networks...
    #option domain-name "example.org";
    #option domain-name-servers ns1.example.org, ns2.example.org;

And in the same file uncomment the `authoritative` line:

    # If this DHCP server is the official DHCP server for the local
    # network, the authoritative directive should be uncommented.
    authoritative;
     
And finally, at the end of the same file, add the following lines:

    subnet 192.168.42.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.42.10 192.168.42.100;
        option broadcast-address 192.168.42.255;
        option routers 192.168.42.1;
        default-lease-time 600;
        max-lease-time 7200;
        option domain-name "raposfly.local";
        option domain-name-servers 192.168.42.1;
    }
    
Then edit `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server` and set `INTERFACES` to `wlan0` so that
the DCHP server is listening on the Wifi:

    INTERFACES="wlan0"
    
The Raspberry Pi should have a fixed address, so not getting it through DHCP.
For this edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces` to comment out the following
`wlan0` related lines and add subsequent ones:

    # iface wlan0 inet manual
    #    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

    iface wlan0 inet static
        address 192.168.42.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0

Set manually the ip address for this session:

    sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.42.1
    
And finally make `isc-dhcp-server` to start at boot:

    sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server

### Install and configure the DNS server

Now that we have a DHCP server, we need a name server that will allow us to
access `raposfly` from the clients directly with a name, not with a IP address.
For this the `dnsmasq` package should be installed:

    sudo apt install -y dnsmasq

Edit `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` to uncomment and change the following lines:

    domain-needed
    bogus-priv
    local=/raposfly.io/
    domain=raposfly.io
    interface=wlan0
    
Add also this at the end of the file so that all URLs will redirect to the
Rapsberry Pi:

    address=/raposfly.io/192.168.42.1

Finally enable the DNS server at boot:

    sudo systemctl enable dnsmasq

### Install and configure the UFW firewall

In order to install a firewall, the `ufw` package should be install with:

    sudo apt install -y ufw
    
Prevent it to block your current SSH connection before starting it:

    sudo ufw allow 22
    
Open also port that will be used later: 80 for HTTP, and 53 for DNS

    sudo ufw allow 80
    sudo ufw allow 53
    
We also want containers in the docker network to communicate together:

    sudo ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/12

Start it right away:

    sudo ufw enable
    
Verify that the rules have been added, better to be sure for SSH (22):

    sudo ufw status verbose

Set UFW to start on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable ufw
    
### Install and configure the Docker engine

In order to run the code, a docker engine is needed. You can obtain and install
docker with:

    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
    
Your user need to be in the docker group to be able to use docker:

    sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker

In order to manage the docker containers with simplicity, `docker-compose`
should be installed:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https
    echo "deb https://packagecloud.io/Hypriot/Schatzkiste/debian/ jessie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hypriot.list
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 37BBEE3F7AD95B3F
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y docker-compose

Docker has the bad habit to play with iptables, what have a tendency to break
UFW rules, so we need the following steps to prevent this:

Edit `/etc/default/ufw` in order to allow UFW to forward request to docker:

    DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"

Modify the file `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/overlay.conf` in order to
prevent docker to play with iptables:

    [Service]
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --storage-driver overlay -H fd:// --iptables=false

Add the following block on the top of `/etc/ufw/before.rules` in order to allow
docker to access the outside world:

    #
    # rules.before
    #
    # Rules that should be run before the ufw command line added rules. Custom
    # rules should be added to one of these chains:
    #   ufw-before-input
    #   ufw-before-output
    #   ufw-before-forward
    #

    # nat Table rules
    *nat
    :POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]

    # Forward trafic from docker through eth0.
    -A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/12 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

    # Don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these nat table rules won't be processed
    COMMIT

Finally we can set docker to start at boot:

    sudo systemctl enable docker
    
### Install and configure the USB driver

In order to allow access to USB devices to users of the `dialout` group, we need
to create a new file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-dialout.rules`:

    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", DRIVER=="usb", MODE="0664", GROUP="dialout"

You should now add yourself to the `dialout` group that has access now to the
USB device:

    sudo gpasswd -a $USER dialout
    
### Verification

Now that everything has been done, it's time to reboot to see if everything is
working as excepted:

    sudo reboot
    
You should now be able to:

- [ ] Connect to the Wifi provided by the Raspberry Pi with your laptop/phone
- [ ] Access internet through the Wifi of the connected client
- [ ] SSH into the Raspberry Pi through the Wifi (192.168.42.1)
- [ ] Check that the firewall is running with `sudo ufw status`
- [ ] See docker information with `docker info`

If yes, you are on the good way!

## Deployement of the project

Now that the base of the Raspberry Pi is configured, we can put the code on it
and start the deploying the application.

For this we will first need to install `git`:

    sudo apt install -y git

### Clone the project on the Raspberry PI

Get the project on the rapsberry with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/StreakyCobra/raposfly.git

If you have your own version of the code, for instance if you have made some
modifications in a fork, you can simply change the URL to your one.

### Build the containers

The containers can simply be built with:

    cd raposfly
    docker-compose build

### Autostart

In order to have raposfly starting at boot, we need to create the file
`/etc/systemd/system/raposfly.service` with the following content:

    [Unit]
    Description=raposfly
    Requires=docker.service
    After=docker.service

    [Service]
    Restart=always
    WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/raposfly/
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up
    ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose down

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    
Be sure to change the line `WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/raposfly/` with the
current path to the `raposfly` folder (user and folder name!).
    
Then enable the service to start at boot:

    sudo systemctl enable raposfly
    
### Verification

In order to verify that everything is working correctly, shutdown the Raspberry
Pi:

    sudo shutdown -h now
    
After the green led has turned off completly, unplug the ethernet cable and the
power cable, and restart the Raspberry Pi by pluging again the power cable (not
the ethernet cable though). With this you would be in a situation that

You should now be able to access the store website by typing `raposfly.io` in a
browser from a client connected through the Wifi!
