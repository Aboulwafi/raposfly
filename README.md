# Presentation

This project provides a temporary, on the fly point of sale that can be deployed
anywhere where a power plug is available. It targets small events such as
village fairs that happen to run once a year. The main focus is to sell food and
drinks through tickets that will then be exchanged at the different desks.

The project is build on top of the _Raspberry Pi_ and support printers that are
supported by
the [`python-escpos`](https://github.com/python-escpos/python-escpos) library.
