**Welcome to the Raposfly documentation.**

The installation_ section explains the procedure to install Raposfly. For now
this part details all the manual steps required to install it. In the future, an
image will be provided with each release so it will be much more simple to
install it. You can find information about the future milestones of the project
in the milestones_ section.

For the developers, the image_ file details rhougly the steps needed to build an
image file that can be directly written to the SD card of a Raspberry Pi 3.
